# Sudoku Solver VR
### Realtime Sudoku solver VR for Digital Image Processing EE3035 class
Because this is DIP class, not Deep Learning so our lecturer explicitly discourage the use of pure DL to solve problem. <br>
Our method make use of simple a MLP digit recognition model trained with MNIST dataset to extract digit from real life image to an array
then apply sudoku back-tracking algorithm to solve that array. <br>
